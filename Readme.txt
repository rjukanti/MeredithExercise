Hello,

As per the exercise.  Here is what was done.

Created test cases on multiple scenarios.  The website give  https://www.allrecipes.com/ homepage did not work.  Attached with this is the image error.  Name of the file is ScreenShot_homepageNotworking.png.  Used https://www.allrecipes.com/ to write test cases.

Test cases have been written in  MeredithTestcases.xlsx.  They have two tabs.  One tab has test cases and other tab has defect report

As perAutomation sample.  I have written code (searchcode.py)

There are multiple files with this repo.
1)  Readme.txt 
2)  ScreenShot_homepageNotworking.png
3)  MeredithTestcases.xlsx
4)  searchallrecipe.py
5) Automationsteps.docx
